# Notes

- "Show Variables" btn doesn't show which fields are required or not telling devs if a field will be undefined
- Prefer ES6 modules
- "Test your DataHook" -> why do I have to hand-jam in data instead of using realistic data?
  - Fields show indicate which fields are required (using an \*)
  - Why are "Test Result" fields editable??
- Create "FlatFile/utils" npm package for customers to use
- Can we enable Typescript? Expose types in a package?
- Can we add a code format button?
- Way too much scrolling up and down when writing Hooks. Code window with is really small, maybe collapse left menu
